My First Responsive Website

I have created this website within 2 days, after I watched a 7-hours-long YouTube video which tries to teach basics of HTML and CSS.

The video ends with a task of creating a responsive webpage which insipired me a lot for first two hours but since I decided to create a different one; I chose the dirty path where I've fallen to pits dozens of times in only 2 days.

I still have some problems about display of the pages on mobile but I don't have enough time to spend for now because I'm in the middle of 2 online bootcamp preparations: The Odin Project(Foundations) and Kodluyoruz (Front-End Development Bootcamp Hazırlık Programı).

I will come back when I'll be an official ninja.

So for now, good-bye grasshopper.
Agu, bugu.
